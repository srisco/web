Hi, I'm Sebastian Risco! I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in Serverless Computing, Cloud Computing and DevOps culture.

I love developing in Go and Python, languages I use in most of the projects I work on, which you can find in my [GitHub](https://github.com/srisco). I'm also a big fan of Open Source and Free Software, especially of the GNU/Linux operating system (I use [arch](https://archlinux.org/), BTWðŸ˜†).

In 2023, I completed my PhD thesis entitled ["Serverless Strategies and Tools in the Cloud Computing Continuum"](https://doi.org/10.4995/Thesis/10251/202013), which I developed during my stage as a researcher in the [Grid and High Performance Computing  research group (GRyCAP)](https://www.grycap.upv.es/) at the [Institute for Molecular Imaging Technologies (i3M)](https://www.i3m.upv.es) of the [Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia](http://www.upv.es), and whose main result was the [OSCAR platform](https://oscar.grycap.net).

Currently, I'm working as a Sr. DevOps engineer in the CBI platform team at Zscaler.
